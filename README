1.0  LDAP Classes for Java

          LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is
          an emerging Internet standard for accessing directory
          information, allowing LDAP-enabled applications to
          access multiple directories. LDAP v3 supports such
          features as secure connections (through SSL and SASL),
          entry management, schema management, and LDAP controls
          and extensions for expanding LDAP's functionality.

          The LDAP Classes for Java enables you to
          write applications to access, manage, update, and
          search for information stored in LDAP-aware directories.

          This API is a work-in-progress implementing the IETF draft 18
          of the Java LDAP API (draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-java-api-18.txt),
          and as such, most but not all features in the IETF draft are
          currently implemented.  For details, see section 2.0.
          
2.0 Known Issues and Solutions

     -    The Java LDAP API IETF 18 draft Features not yet implemented.
     
          Classes do not yet extend Serializable
          
          The API does not return the exception LDAPLocalException in all
          cases where the exception does not originate from the server.

          The class LDAPExtendedResponse does not yet implement the register
          method.
          
          The sasl bind methods are not yet implemented.
          
     -    An incompatibility with previous versions exists for applicatons
          using LDAPSchema.getAtribute() and LDAPSchemaElement.getName().
		  Both methods were deprecated in the May 2002 NDK. These methods
		  have been removed in this release of the API to comply with IETF
		  draft version 18 (draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-java-api-18.txt).
		  The reason for this change is described in the following text.
          
          LDAPSchema now extends LDAPEntry.  This means that LDAPSchema
		  inherits the getAttribute method from LDAPEntry which has the same
		  signature as the getAttribute method of LDAPSchema, but the two
		  methods differ in functionality.  Thus, the getAttribute method of
		  LDAPSchema has been removed from the IETF draft and from the API
          in this release.

          To fix your application, use the getAttributeSchema method of
          LDAPSchema instead of getAttribute.

          The following error will occur when trying to compile code
          using this deprecated method:
                    incompatible types;
                    found: com.novell.ldap.LDAPAttribute,
                    required: com.novell.ldap.LDAPSchemaElement

          The following error will occur when trying to run code using this
          deprecated method:
                    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError

          LDAPSchemaElement now extends LDAPAttribute.  This means that
		  LDAPSchemaElement inherits the getName method from LDAPAttribute
		  which has the same signature as the getName method of
		  LDAPSchemaElement, but the two methods differ in functionality.
		  Thus, the getName method of LDAPSchemaElement has been removed
		  from the IETF draft and from the API in this release.

          To fix your application, use the getNames method of
          LDAPSchemaElement instead of getName.

          Note: You will not get a compile or runtime error if your code
          uses this deprecated method.  You may, however, get errors trying
          to intrepret the data returned.

3.0  Dependencies

     Building the Java LDAP API is dependent upon the following:

     -    JDK 1.4 or higher, required for building classes that 
          use the new DSML functionality. Optionally, you can use JDK 1.2
          or higher by installing the JAXP package and XML parser and
          by and placing the associated jar files the external directory
          external/jaxp as follows:
                external/jaxp/jaxp.jar
                external/jaxp/xerces.jar

     -    JDK 1.4 or higher, required for building classes that reference
          TLS(SSL) connections. Optionally, you can download a Sun-compliant 
          JSSE implementation to compile with JDK 1.2 or higher and place
          the associated jar files in the external/jsse directory as follows:
                external/jsse/lib/jcert.jar
                external/jsse/lib/jnet.jar
                external/jsse/lib/jsse.jar

     -    The Ant build tool for Java, required for building the product.
          Ant was developed by the jakarta.apache.org project and can be
          obtained from their web site.  We have built this system using
          Ant version 1.5.1 compiled on October 2 2002.

          The ant tool is placed in the following directory structure
          under the root of the source.

     Running an application that uses the LDAP Classes for
     Java is dependent upon the following:

     -    JRE 1.2 or higher, required to run an application.
          
     -    JDK/JRE 1.4 or higher, required for running appplications that use
          the new DSML functionality. Optionally, you can use JDK/JRE 1.2 or
          higher by installing the JAXP package and setting the associated 
          jar files in your classpath.

     -    JDK/JRE 1.4 or higher, required for running applications that create
          TLS(SSL) connections. Optionally, you can download a Sun-compliant 
          JSSE implementation to run with JDK/JRE 1.2 or higher.

     -    A directory that supports TLS(SSL), required if you wish to
          run applications that create TLS(SSL) connections.  
          
     -    Novell eDirectory 8.5 or higher, required if you wish to run
          applications that use the LDAP extensions for partition and
          replica management.

     -    Applications that use com.novell.ldap.util.DSMLReader require
          an XML parser (like xerces.jar) in order to run. This jar file needs
          to be in classpath of the Application.


4.0  Installation

     To install the libraries do the following:
     1. Run the build process outlined below.

     2. Copy the ldap.jar file (either debug or release) to a directory
        of your choice on your platform.

     3. Add the complete path, including the file name, of the
        ldap.jar file to your CLASSPATH.

5.0  LDAPv2 and LDAPv3 Support

          This version of the LDAP Classes for Java supports LDAPv3.
          Since the consensus in the LDAP community is to encourage
          everyone to update to LDAPv3, there is no attempt to ensure
          that these libraries support LDAPv2 servers.

6.0  Java LDAP Documentation

     Building JLDAP generates javadoc for the Java LDAP Classes.
     There are three directories containing javadoc.  The index.html
     file is the starting point for the javadoc in each of the directories.
     The directories are:
     
     pkg/ietfdoc  - contains javadoc for the public classes of the IETF LDAP
                    Java API.  These classes are used by applications needing
                    binary compatibility with Java LDAP implementations from 
                    other vendors.
                    
     pkg/doc      - contains javadoc for the public classes of the Novell LDAP
                    Java API.  These classes provide a richer set of
                    functionality than the IETF classes, and are used by
                    applications needing a full featured API.
                    
     doc          - contains javadoc for all classes in the LDAP Java API,
     				and includes package and private methods and variables.
                    This javadoc is typically used by developers developing
                    or modifying the API.
                    
7.0  Building JLDAP

JLDAP is built using a system developed by jakarta.apache.org called ANT.

The build files are named "build.xml" and "javac.xml" and are found in the
root directory of the Java LDAP source.

To set up your environment for ANT, do the following:

For Win32
    Assuming this source directory on win32 is d:\jldap, and java is installed
    in d:\j2sdk1.4.1_1 then you set in your environment:

        set JAVA_HOME=d:\j2sdk1.4.1_1
        set ANT_HOME=d:\jldap\external\ant
        PATH %ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

For Linux / Unix
    Assuming the following:
        1) A Linux system running bourne shell
        2) The source directory is located in /work/jldap
        3) The Java jdk is installed in /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1_1
    then export in your environment:

        ANT_HOME=/work/jldap/external/ant
        JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1_1
        PATH="$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
        export ANT_HOME JAVA_HOME PATH

To build everything except the DSML services, invoke ant as follows from the
top of the source tree:

    ant all

Targets available at the top of the source tree are:
     clean     - Cleans all generated files and directories in this and
                 subbordinate directories
     cleanpkg  - Cleans pkg directory
     cleanwars - Cleans services/dsml directory 
     doc       - Builds javadoc files
     debug     - Builds debug classes and jar files
     release   - Builds release classes and jar files
     lib       - Builds debug & release classes and jar files
     jar       - Synonym for lib
     all       - Builds everything possible except the DSML services. 
                 This builds in all directories - debug and release jar files,
                 java doc, samples, test programs, and creates an installation
                 directory called pkg.
     install   - Copies build results from all directories and creates the
                 pkg directory
     pkg       - Synonym for install
     war_stream- Builds dsmlstream.war (see 8.0 Building DSML Services)
     war_dom   - Builds dsmldom.war (see 8.0 Building DSML Services)
     wars      - Builds dsmlstream.war and dsmldom.war 
     
The following directories are created when "ant all" is run:

    Contents of directories in the ldap directory
        jldap/ldap/classes          # Classes used to build lib/ldap.jar 
        jldap/ldap/classes_debug    # Classes used to build lib_debug/ldap.jar 
        jldap/ldap/doc              # Developer Javadoc for classes in ldap.jar
        jldap/ldap/lib              # Jar file for ldap - optimized, debug off 
        jldap/ldap/lib_debug        # Jar file for ldap - not optimized, debug on 

    Contents of directories in the jldap/pkg directory
        jldap/pkg                   # Distribution directories and files 
        jldap/pkg/doc               # Javadoc for the Java LDAP API
        jldap/pkg/ietfdoc           # Javadoc for the IETF Java LDAP API
        jldap/pkg/lib               # Jar file for ldap - optimized, debug off 
        jldap/pkg/lib_debug         # Jar file for ldap - not optimized, debug on 

8.0 Building DSML Services

The LDAP Classes for Java include functionality that enables an LDAP server to
run as a DSML service. Currently there are two DSML service implementations 
(.war files) that can be generated using the ant build process: dsmlstream.war
and dsmldom.war. See README.dsml for additional information.

     8.1 dsmldom.war
     
     In addition to the dependencies listed in section 3.0, building 
     dsmldom.war is dependent upon the following:
     
     -    Novell eXtend JBroker Web. During the JBroker Web installation, 
          specify the following install location: 
          <javasource_home>/external/JBroker. JBroker Web can be obtained
          at http://developer.novell.com/ndk/jbroker.htm.     

     To build dsmldom.war, invoke ant as follows from the
     top of the source tree:

     ant war_dom

     8.2 dsmlstream.war
     
     In addition to the dependencies listed in section 3.0, building 
     dsmlstream.war is dependent upon the following:
     
     -    servlet.jar. If you have installed JBroker Web, as outlined
          in 8.1, servlet.jar is already installed.  If not, place the
          servlet.jar from your application server (JBroker, tomcat, etc.)
          in the directory <javasource_home>/external/servlet/.
          
     NOTE: dsmlstream.war requires an XML parser (like xerces.jar) in order 
           to run. This jar file needs to be in the classpath of the Web 
           Application Server or Servlet engine running dsmlstream.war.
                    
     To build dsmlstream.war, invoke ant as follows from the
     top of the source tree:

     ant war_stream
          
     You can build both of the above war files by invoking ant as follows:

     ant wars
